Godot Wild Jam #46 entry.

I ended up stopping the Jam early. Mostly because I became overwhelmed trying to complete it, but my goals for my first game jam were not really about finishing the jam as much as doing these three things:
* Iterate quickly over skills that I had just acquired over the last two
years
* Learn some small part of pixel art
  - Which I learned a lot from the Liberated Pixel Cup
  - I also created all of the "shapes" characters, Cyndi, Cublins, and the Great Orb
* Learn to use the Godot Steering AI Framework (not in its entirety, but enough to begin using it)
* Got a better learning of tilesets; tilemaps
* Better organization of assets, code, and the different resource files handling their
interactions.

I accomplished all of these goals for myself. The good thing is that
just hours after I decided to stop the power in our area was knocked
out by a storm. That power outage lasted for 16 hours. Half of the last
part of the jam would have been very stressful for me had I not already
decided to stop for this jam. I hope in the future to finish one, but
my most important goals are to learn something in doing the jam.
